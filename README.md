This plugin integrates with Grails' [resources framework](https://github.com/grails-plugins/grails-resources) to automatically
compress javascript using the Google Closure [compiler]
(https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/).

By default, in this alpha, all files ending with .js will be
compressed. All other files, including files ending with .min.js, are
ignored.

This plugin is based on the [YUI minify resources](https://github.com/cblock/yui-minify-resources) plugin, and licensed under Apache License, Version 2.0.
